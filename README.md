# Link Social Media

## Project Description
Link is the second iteration of a social media application created by Team Avatar as part of the Revature Full Stack Angular training program in April 2021. Developed with a microservice architecture, this web application allows every user to follow each other and view each other's posts. Each user has their own account that they can customize with their own information. Within this network, users can interact with each other through comments, likes, and a global chatroom.
